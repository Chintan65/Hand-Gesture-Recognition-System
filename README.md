# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-System
## Deep Learning(LSTM), OpenCV, MediaPipe, Python
This project implements a real-time hand gesture detection system using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and deep learning techniques. It captures hand gestures using MediaPipe and generates datasets for training. The deep learning model is built using a sequence of LSTM layers and dense layers to classify hand gestures accurately. The trained model achieves a classification accuracy of 77.77% on the test dataset. The system is suitable for real-time applications requiring gesture recognition tasks.
